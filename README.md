>Project Submission

>#Getting Feedback
>Throughout your Nanodegree program, you will submit your work for review. When you submit a project, you will receive a grade that >indicates either that you've passed that stage or that you need to work on your project and submit again.

>#Important:
>You will not receive a grade for your Stage 0 submission (but you will receive feedback)
>We want you to submit your notes from the first lesson within one week of beginning the Nanodegree, but there will not be any >consequences for missing this deadline.
>Future stages (Stage 1 - Stage 5) should try to be completed on time.
>This is a formative checkpoint designed to give you immediate feedback and ensure you have the confidence and the support you need to >keep moving forward.
>#Stage 0 Project:
>Write your notes in an html file using the tags learned in this Stage such as ~~~~ <p>,<div>, <h1>, <b>, <em>, <span> ~~~~ 
>Keep it simple. CSS for styling is not necessary for the Project.
>Make sure you use proper HTML Document structure for your code. Refer to this lesson if you need help with this structure.
>Once you are ready with your html file, use the Submit Project button to upload your project for review!
